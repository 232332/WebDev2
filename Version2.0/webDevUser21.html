        <h1>Harambe</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Harambe was wrongfully killed in his enclosure</h2>
            <p>Harambe was chilling in his enclosure minding his own
                business but then a child fell in everyone started to panic
                Harambe saw the child and saved him by cuddling him stoping his wounds 
                from bleeding out. But the zoo they had a different idea instea of tranquelizing 
                like they should of they instead shot harambe and killing the gentle creature 
                right then and there.
            </p>Further studies have found that harambe deserved to live and could have 
            further developed human evolution through his own dna

            <h2>Candy</h2>
            <p>Physically, candy is characterized by the use of a significant amount of sugar or sugar substitutes. Unlike a cake or loaf of bread that would be shared among many people, candies are usually made in smaller pieces. However, the definition of candy also depends upon how people treat the food. Unlike sweet pastries served for a dessert course at the end of a meal, candies are normally eaten casually, often with the fingers, as a snack between meals. Each culture has its own ideas of what constitutes candy rather than dessert. The same food may be a candy in one culture and a dessert in another.</p>
