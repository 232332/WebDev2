                        <p>


                            This is my first webpage! I was able to code all the HTML and CSS in order to make it. I am Mitch<del>ell</del> Berg, a junior at <abbr title="Shakopee High School">SHS</abbr>.

    <h3>Skills</h3>

                        <p>


                                I can use my coding skills here to create websites for <del>my business</del>, my friends and family, to show my sports history, to document my bowling adventures <ins>and maybe tips on how to bowl better.</ins> As well as any games or more experiment stuff (which is what the web is really all about). As you can tell from the previous paragraph, I am a <sub>(slightly)</sub> skilled <strong>bowler</strong>, I do it as a sport not because I would become popular at school, but because I really love to do it. <small>It's a lot of fun and everyone can do it.</small>

<h3>Mitch Berg and his Bowling.</h3>
    
    <p>
    <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bowling+definition&surl=1&safe=active&ssui=on">Bowling</a> is a sport that is played several different ways, depending on the way you might do it and the level of competition you may be at. So, the way a recreational bowler may bowl is going to be different from the way I bowl, just because I am competing at a higher level of bowling. For example, a lot of recreational bowlers may not be releasing the ball correctly. The way a bowling ball should be released is by having the thumb come outof the ball first and then the fingers come out a split second after to ensure consistency, power and hook. If you want to see more terms click <a href="https://www.pba.com/Resources/BowlingLingo">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>The way I bowl is a growing style being used by more and more bowlers across the planet, <a href="https://www.bowl.com/News/NewsDetails.aspx?id=12884906700">the "two handed style"</a>. this style involves great power with <abbr title="Revolutions Per Minute">RPM's</abbr>, an average <abbr title="Professional Bowlers Association">PBA</abbr> bowlers RPM's hanging at around 430rpm. But with this two handed style the RPM's reach about 475rpm without really trying, some even get up to 550-625rpm. This is because generally when someone is bowlign with the two handed style, they aren't using their thumb on their bowling hand. (They just have their middle and ring fingers in the bowling ball.) This means there is no "drag" from the thumb rubbing on the side of the thumb hole, the fingers just come out and they create the power because the bowler doesn't have to worry about getting their thumb out smoothly. It's a thing of beauty when it is done correctly. Here's an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYt92-RYc4">example</a>.
