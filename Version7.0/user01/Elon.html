            <h1> About Elon Musk</h1>

            <h3>
                <img src="images/Elon%20Musk%20Point.jpeg" style="height:500px;">

                <p>

                    Elon Musk, (born June 28, 1971, Pretoria, South Africa), South African-born American entrepreneur who cofounded the electronic-payment firm PayPal and formed SpaceX, maker of launch vehicles and spacecraft. He was also one of the first significant investors in, as well as chief executive officer of, the electric car manufacturer Tesla.

                </p>
                <p>

                    <h4 onmouseover="style.color='light_blue'" onmouseout="style.color='black'">Elon Musk is working to revolutionize transportation both on Earth and in space.
                        His automaker, Tesla Motors, which was founded in 2003, is bringing fully-electric vehicles to the mass market.
                        SpaceX, Musk's rocket company, is now valued at more than $20 billion.
                        He grew up in South Africa, then immigrated to Canada at age 17. He landed in the US as a transfer student at the University of Pennsylvania.

               <h1> Joe Rogan Podcast:</h1>
                
                <p>On 6 September 2018, Musk appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast and discussed various topics for over two hours. Within five days, the appearance had accrued 10 million YouTube views. One of the highest profile and controversial aspects of the program was Musk's sampling a single puff from a cigar consisting, Rogan claimed, of tobacco laced with cannabis. To Rogan's inquiry on how often he smoked cannabis, Musk replied: "Almost never. I know a lot of people like weed and that's fine, but I don't find that is very good for productivity... not for me." Tesla stock then proceeded to drop extremely low due to the inconfidence investors and Tesla had in him.</p>
