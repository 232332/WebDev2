<strong>The Land You’re Standing On</strong>

<p>This parkland has seen many changes over time. A landscape shaped by glaciers more than 10,000 years ago, the area was once an expanse of marshland used as a seasonal camp by Minnesota’s first people, the Dakota and the Ojibwe. In the late 1800s, the site held an armory and parade grounds. In the early 1900s, formal gardens and a series of sports fields were established by the Park Board. When the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden opened in 1988, it was one of the first major public/private urban sculpture parks of its kind in the United States.</p>

<strong>The Nature of Art</strong>

<p>The Minneapolis Sculpture Garden is home to more than 40 outdoor sculptures. Generations of artists from 10 different countries around the world created these artworks. Many of the works are site-specific and made especially for this public park—from the iconic Spoonbridge and Cherry centerpiece to structures that offer spaces for gathering, conversation, or dreaming. Rediscover the Garden’s art and natural beauty through Minnesota’s ever-changing seasons.</p>   

<strong>It Takes a Village</strong>

<p>What happens when experts from many fields—architects, curators, designers, artists, landscape architects, gardeners, environmentalists, writers, scientists, and many others—come together with community members to reimagine a beloved public space? The result of this multifaceted partnership is a forward-thinking design for the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden, which was fully reconstructed in 2017. The site features ecologically sustainable water management, a flourishing habitat for plants and wildlife, and creative landscape elements that showcase the artworks in nature.
