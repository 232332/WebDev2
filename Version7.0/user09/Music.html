                                1. First we have California Girls. This song is made by Katy Perry. The most popular song in all of California. Although the music is amazing, awesome lyrics and outstanding acting. I am afraid this music video is not for kids, it is not family friendly. The song is about what girls do in California. This video is 10 years old.  
                                2. Next we have California Dreamin'. this song is made by Gabroz. This songs tells us what California was in the early 1900's. The graphics are gray and dim. It also shows us what people used to do back then in California. This video is 13 years old.
                                3. Finally we have the basic name California. This song is made by Phantom Planet. This song shows us what California is today. What you can do, what you can see and what a beautiful place it really is. This song is 11 years old.
