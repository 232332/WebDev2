1. First we have Venice Beach. Venice Beach is the biggest beach in California, with thousands of people on it each passing day. People go surfing, swimming, canoeing, and even fishing. And with the best sun rises, and the best sunsets. 
2. Next we have the Dante's View or as some call it Death Valley. Its called Death Valley because of what lerks there. Some of the most dangerous animals and insects live in that area. Although it is extremily dangerous, it has some of the best torist attractions in California and fabulous views.
3. Next we have Disney Land. Like Disney World but has a little less to see and do. But never the less it has the same thing as Disney World but it has more bright and beautiful lights and it has very high roller coasters, and bigger grounds for games and other fun activities. 
4. Next we have one of the most popular attractions in California. The Golden Gate Bridge. The Golden Gate Bridge is the longest and the biggest bridge in the world. Since the bridge first opened in 1937 billions of people have rode upon the grand structure. The bridge has a beautiful orangish color with a lengh of 20,000 feet long. 
5. Last but not least we have the Redwood National Park. California's number one place to visit. The park has so much to offer. The park has 5 zoos that have some of the most rare animals on the planet, 3 water parks which gets thousands of people each day, hundredes of bike trails and the park has woods that go on for 15 miles long which contains geysers, views and even a volcano.
