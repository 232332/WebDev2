                                This is my final webpage! This page will simply explain what making this website was like, how long it took and what I put in it.

                               This website was a lot of fun. It took me a long time to make it. It took me 7 hours. It may not much, but I tried my best. In this website I added text, lists, tables and many, many images. This was my Version 7 Website Assigment. I hoped you enjoyed it.
