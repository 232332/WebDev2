                            This is my fifth webpage! This webpage will talk about the most popular resturant in all of California. Benu!!! Benu is the best in California. I will talk about what Benu will offer, what it has, how many people go there a day and some food examples(a menu). 
 
                        </p>

The Benu is an ancient Egyptian deity linked with the sun, creation, and rebirth. It may have been the inspiration for the phoenix in Greek mythology. It is huge. Over three hundred seats with dozens of tables. The place has a fountain right in the middle of it. Some say that one million people come and eat there every single day. The places most popular food item is sea food. Lobster, crab legs, cat fish, sunfish and much, much more. Plenty of meat products as well. This place is on the top 50 resturaunt list in the whole world.
